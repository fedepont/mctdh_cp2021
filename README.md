" MCTDH is a general algorithm to solve the time-dependent Schrödinger equation for multidimensional dynamical systems consisting of distinguishable particles.
  MCTDH can thus determine the quantal motion of the nuclei of a molecular system evolving on one or several coupled electronic potential energy surfaces.
  MCTDH by its very nature is an approximate method. However, it can be made as accurate as any competing method, but its numerical efficiency deteriorates
  with growing accuracy. "

I have created this repository to make a final proyect of the postgraduate course called Parallel Computation
from Faculty of Mathematic, Astronomy, Physics and Computation (FaMAF) of National University of Córdoba (UNC).
