# Final proyect repository

## (M)ulti (C)onfiguration (T)ime (D)ependent (H)artree

> MCTDH is a general algorithm to solve the time-dependent Schrödinger equation for multidimensional dynamical systems consisting of distinguishable particles.

> MCTDH can thus determine the quantal motion of the nuclei of a molecular system evolving on one or several coupled electronic potential energy surfaces.

> MCTDH by its very nature is an approximate method. However, it can be made as accurate as any competing method, but its numerical efficiency deteriorates with growing accuracy.
  
## Goal

> I have created this repository to make a final proyect of the postgraduate course called Parallel Computation
from Faculty of Mathematic, Astronomy, Physics and Computation (FaMAF) of National University of Córdoba (UNC).

## Repository contents

* DVR
  * The (D)iscrete (V)ariable (R)epresentation is a powerful method for representing wavefunctions and operators and numerically solve problems of quantum mechanics.
  * Here we used Sine DVR and Lapack to diagonalize different Hamiltonian operators.

* test_oscillator
  * Here we used MCTDH package to study Harmonic Oscillator with/without interaction potential.

* double_quantum_dot_model
  * Here we used MCTDH package and Sine DVR program to analyse the double quantum dot model.
