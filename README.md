# Final proyect repository

> MCTDH is a general algorithm to solve the time-dependent Schrödinger equation for multidimensional dynamical systems consisting of distinguishable particles.

> MCTDH can thus determine the quantal motion of the nuclei of a molecular system evolving on one or several coupled electronic potential energy surfaces.

> MCTDH by its very nature is an approximate method. However, it can be made as accurate as any competing method, but its numerical efficiency deteriorates with growing accuracy. "
  
## Goal

> I have created this repository to make a final proyect of the postgraduate course called Parallel Computation
from Faculty of Mathematic, Astronomy, Physics and Computation (FaMAF) of National University of Córdoba (UNC).
