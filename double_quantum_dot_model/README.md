## Goal

> I have created this repository to make a final proyect of the postgraduate course called Parallel Computation
from Faculty of Mathematic, Astronomy, Physics and Computation (FaMAF) of National University of CÃ³rdoba (UNC).

## Repository contents

* mctdh folder
  * Here we used *Sine DVR* and *Lapack* to represent and diagonalize different Hamiltonian operators.
